## Instructions

Two folders are created, one containing ipython Notebooks for each subtask : 
1. LCP subtask-1 single; contains "Single_Final.ipynb"
2. LCP subtask-2 multi; contains "Multi_Final.ipynb"

Each folder has corresponding .ipynb notebook file, open to view or open in colab to try and execute.

NOTE: This repo contains code for the best performing model we have tried so far, for exploring all of our work visit [Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13FLrsgNh_AiGIdTF1OtO78vDdsIjQ416?usp=sharing).

## Requirements
Most of the necessary requirements are already available in Google Colab ; and for others explicit code is written in the Notebook to install those from external sources.
