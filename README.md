## Instructions

Two folders are created, one containing ipython Notebooks for each subtask. Open the notebooks to view ; or open in Jupyter or Google Colab to try and execute. Contents of the Folders : 
1. LCP subtask-1 single; contains "Single_Final.ipynb"
2. LCP subtask-2 multi; contains "Multi_Final.ipynb"

**We recommend Google Colab for execution of the notebooks** *(Since, we have created and tested all of the sections on Colab)*

NOTE: This repo contains code for the best performing model we have tried so far! To explore all of our work, visit [Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13FLrsgNh_AiGIdTF1OtO78vDdsIjQ416?usp=sharing).

It is highly encouraged to go through the following video & the submitted report

## Requirements
Most of the necessary requirements are already available in Google Colab ; and for others explicit code is written in the Notebook to install those from external sources.

**Thanks!**
