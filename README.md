## Instructions

Two folders are created, one containing ipython Notebooks for each subtask. Open the notebooks to view ; or open in Jupyter or Google Colab to try and execute. Contents of the Folders : 
1. LCP subtask-1 single; contains "Single_Final.ipynb" & "README.md". ***README contains Colab link to notebook.***
2. LCP subtask-2 multi; contains "Multi_Final.ipynb" & "README.md". ***README contains Colab link to notebook.***

**We recommend Google Colab for execution of the notebooks** *(We have created and tested all of the sections on Colab)*

We highly encourage going through the following Presentation Video & the submitted Report in tandem, or in adjacent timeframes. The Report & the Presentations are **almost** each self-sufficient, but due to the respective 15-min & 5-page limits, there were limitations on what content we could cover *(Certain things are covered better in the video than the report, & vice versa)*. It would be simpler to make complete sense of our work by going through both.

**NOTE**: This repo contains code for the best performing model we have tried so far! To explore all of our work, visit [Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13FLrsgNh_AiGIdTF1OtO78vDdsIjQ416?usp=sharing).

## Requirements
Most of the necessary requirements are already available in Google Colab ; and for others explicit code is written in the Notebook to install those from external sources.

**Thanks!**
